            <p2>Tasked with creating 500 files encompassing 25 distinct file types, this website serves as an exploration into different outcomes similar to choosing different
                paths during a walk.
           </p2>
            <p2>Anatomy of a Walk is a virtual landscape of memory and experience. From digital recreations of senses that transport 
                you to different locations, to pieces of landmarks taken from personal memories, you can navigate through the 
                complex webpages that break down the various components of a simple walk. This  online collection  combines
                 the material and the immaterial, providing an examination of the act of going for a walk.
                 Explore through the page or rather put down your device and actually go on a walk. (preferbally after exploring the page)
